					I was born and raised in Aguascalientes, Mexico and have 20+ years of varied 
					construction experience.  Since 1997, I have been working with concrete 
					specifically decorative concrete.   My experience includes every aspect of 
					various concrete projects from acid staining, stamped concrete, waterfalls, 
					boulders and retaining walls.   
					<p>
					I have a  very artistic eye and often work with the client to plan their 
					project and offer suggestions and recommendations when they are unsure.  
					My experience enables me to work with either existing structures to make 
					modifications and to further enhance the project or to create something 
					completely new from scratch.
					<p> 
					Doing the job right the first time is a core value of mine and I am 
					oftentimes considered a perfectionist in my jobs.  Once a client has worked 
					with me and understands my work ethic and sees the finished product, I am 
					frequently asked to work on future projects and am referred to others.
					<p>
