<a name="whyconcrete"><strong>Why choose Decorative Concrete?</strong></a>
<p>
Concrete designs are one of the hot new trends for concrete patios, concrete floors, entryways, countertops, pool decks and more. From expansive new homes with elaborate concrete driveways to budgeted one-room remodels showcasing a stunning, stained concrete floor, the attractionis continuing to grow when it comes to using concrete for decorating. Concrete is no longer plain, grey and boring, it is now thought of as a beautiful decorative element.

<a name="benefits"><strong>What are the benefits of Decorative Concrete?</strong></a>
<p>
<ul>
<li>It enhances the integrity of architect's designs. 
<li>They are easy to maintain. 
<li>It's easy to change, especially if you sell your home; the next owner can place carpet or wood on top of the concrete slab. 
<li>They are great in extreme weather conditions. 
<li>They are a good alternative to carpet if you have allergies. 
</ul>

<a name="stain"><strong>What is Stained Concrete?</strong></a>
<p>
Stained Concrete is not a paint or coating agent, rather, it’s a coloring process involving a chemical reaction on a cementitious material. A solution made with water, acid and inorganic salts reacts with minerals already present in the concrete, the result of this reaction is color. It works very well on new or old concrete, and we’ve seen impressive results over decorative polymer overlays as well as self-leveling products. Stained Concrete is a very durable product if properly protected with sealer or wax, and it can be applied to both interiors and exteriors. 
<p>

<a name="overlay"><strong>What is an Overlay?</strong></a>
<p>

With today's decorative overlays, it's easy to give almost any concrete surface, indoors or out, a complete face-lift and at a much lower cost than removal and replacement. The real challenge is choosing from among the many resurfacing products available and the diverse array of decorative finishes possible. There are multiple options available for achieving any look imaginable with a concrete overlay.  Cement-based overlays have been around for decades, however many of today's systems blend polymer resins with cement, sand, and other additives to improve performance, wear resistance, and aesthetic qualities. Polymer-modified overlays can be applied in layers as thin as a credit card or up to several inches thick without delamination or failure. They adhere well to existing concrete and resist damage from salt, chemicals, UV exposure, freeze-thaw conditions, and abrasion.

<a name="waterfeatures"><strong>What pool features and waterfall features can be made out of concrete?</strong></a>
<p>

There are a variety of pool and waterfall features that can be made out of concrete.
<ul>
<li>In-ground spas accented by waterfalls are both functional and visually stimulating.


<li>Faux rock turns a traditional unadorned pool into a tropical paradise. The artificial rock can accommodate most any feature with ease including waterfalls, swim jets,lights, seating, spa jets, and more.


<li>Faux-rock fish ponds are affordable and easy to install. And the materials used to make the rock are not toxic to water life.


<li>Artificial boulders create an 8-foot-tall retaining wall that blends beautifully with its surroundings. Two waterfalls built into the wall add sound and movement.


<li>Faux-rock construction lends itself well to modifying and enhancing existing features. Any kind of rock feature can be built onto an existing swimming pool.


<li>Artificial flagstone is an attractive, practical decking surface for a swimming pool. Not only is the faux stone durable, it also stays cool during the summer.


<li>Molding techniques can produce artificial rock formations that precisely replicate the texture and finish of real rock.


<li>Artificial stone also can be applied to vertical surfaces. The stone veneer accenting the walls of this home was built in-place for much less than the cost of installingmanufactured stone.
</ul>

<a name="wall"><strong>What is a retaining wall?</strong></a><p>
Retaining walls provide lateral support to vertical slopes of soil. They retain soil which would otherwise collapse into a more natural shape. The retained soil is sometimes referred to as "backfill."  Retaining walls can be constructed of many different materials and with a variety of building techniques. Retaining Walls that are constructed from the bottom up and where a stable backslope exists (at least temporarily) prior to wall construction. With poured concrete retaining walls, backfill is placed between the wall and the slope after the wall is constructed.

<p>
<a name="stamp"><strong>What is Stamped Concrete?</strong></a>
<p>
Concrete patios, sometimes referred to as cement patios, provide the perfect sanctuary for outdoor living spaces because they are often connected to the house and blend the interior with the exterior living areas. For example, homeowners can match the stone facade of their house by installing decorative concrete to create a stone patio without the expense of installing traditional individual stones. With stamped concrete, homeowners can get the look of flagstone, brick and many other patterns when stamp patterns are pressed into freshly poured concrete.
